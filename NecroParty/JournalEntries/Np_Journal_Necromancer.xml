"This mod makes dramatic gameplay changes for {color=#0BDA51}Necromancer{/color} players.

Goal:
More variety in winning strategies.
Give less used mechanics and ships a purpose.
Make each Necromancer game and galaxy feel more varied.

Details:
* {u}Templar Rifts{/u} are now {u}pre-seeded{/u} across the galaxy and do not spawn over time. You will discover what is available in the galaxy as you explore it and make best use of what is there. 
* All lines and flagships have been tweaked to have a value appropriate to their costâ€”and could be all you can find anyway!"
