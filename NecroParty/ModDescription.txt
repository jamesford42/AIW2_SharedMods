This mod makes dramatic gameplay changes for <color=#0BDA51>Necromancer</color> players.

Goal:
More variety in winning strategies.
Give less used mechanics and ships a purpose.
Make each Necromancer game and galaxy feel more varied.

Details:
* <u>Templar Rifts</u> are now <u>pre-seeded</u> across the galaxy and do not spawn over time. You will discover what is available in the galaxy as you explore it and make best use of what is there. 
* All lines and flagships have been tweaked to have a value appropriate to their cost .. and could be all you can find anyway!
