Changes the gameplan of the templar to a less exploitable idea, these templar can build power on their own merit much more efficiently rather than forming a co-dependance on AIP, putting real pressure on necromancers and forcing them to advance the gamestate.

These templar may be easier to hack, as they won't send as many wave leaders in that instance, but given enough time, they will go on crusades - amassing strength quickly in order to finish off Necromancers who they feel are weak and easy to finish off.
